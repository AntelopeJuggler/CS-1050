 * Problem: Accept input of four integers, then perform and output various calculations using them. Use the C programming language
 * 
 * Solution: I used scanf, int, various operators, and the "%d" format specifier
 * 
 * Reference: Used w3schools' description of scanf function to inform my methodology
